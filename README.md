# Toxic-gas-detector

I had done a research about pollutions inside cars when I was at sixth grade of primary school. 
I just searched out for reasons that caused these pollutions, the consequence that would be possibly 
brought by these pollutions and what are the pollutions actually. In spite of this, I still think that 
we should first get a detection of these pollutions if we really want to solve the problem. Furthermore, 
this kind of detection needs to be performed by a device and this performance should be fully visible and 
easy-to-understand. Nevertheless I was just an 11-year old primary school student at then, I was not only 
in the lack of electrical knowledge to assemble the device, but also had no materials for me to make this 
device too. However, those problems are totally solved when I came to Litchee. Right now I have finished 
my device and you can find it on Instructables.com:

where I posted the whole process making this device on it. Overall, my point is being that Litchee kind of 
provided me with a platform that has the entire basis for me to accomplish my thoughts. In fact, many people 
have their thoughts about many things, and this is where you can make them come true.
